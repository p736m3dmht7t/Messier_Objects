Create a Python script named Messier_Objects.py that calculates the visibility of Messier objects during the night between the end of evening astronomical twilight and the start of morning astronomical twilight for a specified location. The script should meet the following requirements:

Configuration:
Load location details (latitude, longitude, altitude, timezone) from a .env file in the current directory.
Expected .env variables: LATITUDE (decimal degrees), LONGITUDE (decimal degrees, West negative), ALTITUDE (meters), TIMEZONE (IANA name, e.g., 'America/Chicago').
Validate inputs and exit with an error if invalid (latitude -90 to 90, longitude -180 to 180) or missing.
Handle inline comments (after #) and whitespace in .env values.

Astronomical Calculations:
Use astroplan, astropy, and numpy libraries.
Calculate the upcoming evening astronomical twilight end (t_evening_astro_twil_end) and morning astronomical twilight start (t_morning_astro_twil_start) using astroplan.Observer.
Compute Local Sidereal Time (LST) at these twilight times and at the Sun’s anti-meridian (midpoint of the night) for output purposes only, not for filtering.
Include objects that are above 30 degrees altitude at least at one of:
Evening twilight (t_evening_astro_twil_end).
Transit time, if it occurs within the observation window (between twilight times).
Morning twilight (t_morning_astro_twil_start).
Do not filter objects based on their RA relative to the LST range.

Object Visibility:
Process Messier objects M1 to M110 using astroplan.FixedTarget.from_name.
For each object:
Calculate transit time using target_meridian_transit_time with which="nearest" relative to the Sun’s anti-meridian time.
Calculate rise time (altitude crossing 30°) using target_rise_time with which="previous" relative to the transit time.
Calculate set time using target_set_time with which="next" relative to the transit time.
Compute maximum altitude at transit using observer.altaz.
Flag objects as circumpolar if their declination > (90 - latitude) degrees; for these, set rise/set times to None (display as "Circumpolar").
Include an object if its altitude exceeds 30° at any of the three key times (evening twilight, transit within window, morning twilight).

Output Formatting:
Mark rise times before evening twilight and set times after morning twilight with an asterisk (*) in the output.
Format RA as 'HH MM SS.S' (hourangle, space-separated, 1 decimal second).
Format Dec as '+DD MM SS' (degrees, space-separated, whole seconds, always show sign).
Format times as 'HH:MM:SS TZ' (timezone from .env), omitting the date, or "N/A" if invalid, or "Circumpolar" for circumpolar objects.
Sort objects by RA in the output.
Display a table with columns: Object, RA (J2000), Dec (J2000), Rise > 30°, Transit, Max Alt, Set < 30°.
Write results to a timestamped file (Messier_Objects_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt) with a header including:
Location (latitude, longitude, altitude).
Timezone.
Observation window (full date/time).
LST range (for reference).
Sun’s anti-meridian time and LST.
Total number of objects.
Altitude threshold (>30°).
Notes explaining the inclusion criteria, asterisk meaning, circumpolar definition, and that times use direct astroplan calculations.

Error Handling:
Exit with an error if required libraries (python-dotenv, astropy, numpy, astroplan) are missing, with instructions to install (e.g., pip install astropy).
Handle invalid .env files, missing variables, or invalid values gracefully.
Catch exceptions for individual object calculations (e.g., name lookup failures for M102) and print a warning, continuing to the next object.
Handle masked or invalid times (e.g., np.ma.core.MaskedConstant) by displaying "N/A".
Suppress common AstropyWarning messages to reduce noise.

Additional Requirements:
Use astropy.units for all angle and altitude calculations.
Ensure the script is robust for various latitudes (e.g., polar regions where twilight may behave differently).
Print progress messages (e.g., "Checking 110 Messier objects...", "Found X objects meeting the criteria").
Exit cleanly if twilight calculations fail (e.g., in polar regions).

Output Example:
For a location like Lat=31.5473, Lon=-99.3827, Alt=446m, Timezone=America/Chicago:

Please generate the complete script, ensuring it meets all requirements, is well-documented with comments, and produces output matching the specified format. Save results to a timestamped file and handle all edge cases robustly.
